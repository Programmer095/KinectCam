# KinectCam
This project is the code posted by ScottOrange on the MSDN. He developed a small program to allow use of the Kinect Camera as a webcam. 
Originally made for the Beta, he updated the code to the version 1.0 microsoft SDK.http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/kinectsdk/thread/4ee6e7ca-123d-4838-82b6-e5816bf6529c 

This codebase will be used as a starting point to bring compatibility to the 2.0 version of the Kinect SDK.
This is for no reason other than I have a connect laying around that I would like to put to use.  
My intention is to update the compatibility information below as relevant.

Compatibility:
Skype on x86 - Pending
Skype on x64 - Pending
